For each of the browser history workouts, I had to do about 3 attempts before successfully reaching the goal. The first attempt was a refresher to ensure that I retained all of the knowledge and understood the assignment's tasks. I have a habit of forgetting to record my voice. My second effort usually entails creating errors in the middle of the assignment, at which point I become stuck and turn to the internet for tutorials to better comprehend the code's properties and characteristics. My third attempt is better since I am more detail-oriented to prevent creating mistakes.

Browser History 1

1 - Practice round with no narration: about 25 minutes - Sd
2 - Screencast with audio: about 20 minutes - Sd
3 - Final screencast: 19 minutes - Av

Since it’s been years since I last wrote a single line of code, I caught myself making errors that were overlooked by my rushed speed. Then, instead of worrying about the timer, I decided to slow down and work naturally, knowing that I could repeat the procedure for better understanding. My initial attempt resulted in a DNF time. My first blunder was not saving my progress before refreshing the website, but I soon learned my lesson. Secondly, one of the headings and the first sentence of the introduction appeared to be a link even though the attribute was not wrapped around the sentence. I carefully resumed the process from the beginning while keeping track of the time. I watched the video for help on my second attempt because I was having trouble attaching a heading within the website rather than an actual link.  The usage of the properties to link with the ID all made sense from there. The final time of completion on my last attempt was 19:06.

Browser History 2

1 - Practice round with no narration: about 15 minutes - Av
2 - Screencast with audio: about 10 minutes - Av
3 - Final screencast: about 7 minutes - Rx

The first issue I had as I progressed to the second WOD was altering the typefaces. I was stuck on making the logos in line with the text after I bypassed the conflict and changed the text and background colors. After looking into more information on W3Schools, I discovered that I needed to utilize the float property to position the element so that the paragraph would wrap around the image. While still having issues with the text, I watched the video and learned about Google Fonts, which gave me an "aha" moment because I had done a reading for this but had forgotten to apply it to the practice.

Browser History 3

1 - Practice round with no narration: about 20 minutes - Sd
2 - Screencast with audio: about 13-15 minutes - Av
3 - Final screencast: about 7 minutes - Rx

Finally, the third WOD was the one with the fewest steps but the greatest problems. I went over 20 minutes (DNF) because I couldn't get the three browser portions to line up properly. The Chrome part would appear beneath Firefox at random. I struggled with CSS since I didn't consider one of the most significant attributes until after watching the video. W3Schools and Stack Overflow both assisted me in understanding the purpose of each property and how to use the properties to execute the results in this situation.

My Advice

Overall, I learned to be patient and self-learn for myself as I was too worried about the timer. I eventually ethically used the Athletic Approach to work on my progress and improve my skills. I don’t have to know everything on the go, rather learn from failure, and try again.

I strongly advise practicing without regard to the time, especially on the initial attempt when knowledge is limited. Understand that it’s okay to make mistakes because the purpose of this exercise is to learn from failure.
